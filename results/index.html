					<h2>Individual Results</h2>
					<div id="loading">Loading...</div>

					<div id="my_results" style="display: none">
						<p>When it comes to top-down visual processing, you scored better than <strong><span id="my_ranking"></span>%</strong> of people.</p> 
						<p>The higher your score, the easier it is for your visual system to identify things based on prior knowledge. For full implications, check out <a href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-nature-of-hallucinations/" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>. Please keep in mind that there are some limitations with this little test, so take your result with a grain of salt.</p>

					<h2>Thoughts</h2>
					<p>At the time of writing (3 Jan 2016), the average discrimination sensitivity <em>(ability to differentiate between control images with nothing in them, and signal images with people/animals in them)</em> increased from 0.62 to 0.66 between the before and after blocks, an increase of 0.04. This is a much smaller increase than the ~0.3 increase (~0.55 to ~0.85) in the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/43/13401.full.pdf" target="_blank">original study</a>.</p>

					<p>This may be due to the nature of this replication, a "throwaway" online test rather than a "serious" sit-down test with a supervisor as in the original study. It may also be due to the number of sessions, 4 rather than the original 16, 4 may be too few to really get confortable with the test. Another cause may be the test images themselves. The test images I chose may not be as easy to recognise after priming as the ones used in the original study.</p>

					<p>The criterion shift <em>(a lower criterion indicates a response
bias to report the presence of a person)</em> went from -0.26 to -0.32 in the before and after blocks, a decrease of 0.06. The original study had a shift from ~0.05 to ~-0.1, a decrease of ~0.15. This indicates that my test subjects' confidence after priming increased only about a third as much as in the original study. This also agrees with the discrimination sensitivity results.</p>

					<p>Overall, as a side project, this was fun to build and relatively successful. The results above tell me that if I or someone were to spend a little more time getting good test images (see guidelines in the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2015/10/06/1503916112.DCSupplemental/pnas.201503916SI.pdf#nameddest=STXT" target="_blank">materials and methods PDF</a>), this little tool could be an accurate assesment of a person's top-down visual processing ability, and all the implications that go along with it.</p>

					<h2>Thanks</h2>
