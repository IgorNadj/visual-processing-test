templates (colour) (40 minimum)
 - people
 - animals

stimuli (two tone / black and white) (80 minimum - generated 40x2)
 - test
 - control

Generation:
 - the templates generate both the test and control images (each template image generates one test image and one control image). 
 - the test image is generated with a threshold filter (possibly a blur first to remove noise?).
 - the control image is generated by inverting the image, then moving parts around, then the same threshold filter as for the test image.


Test process:
Each test consists of 16 sessions!! <-- cut this down to 4?

One session consistes of:
1. before block (test)
2. template blocks (prime)
3. after block (test)

- PRE: pick a set of images
 - 10 templates
 - pick at random <-- only pick templates they have not seen before in a previous session
 - order randomly
 - for each template, pick either a test stimuli or a control

- test block
 - (pick 10 stimuli at random)
 - show stimulus for 400ms
 - noise mask 100ms
 - answer (no time limit) person yes/no ?
 - // ITI 750ms ? what is this

- template blocks
 - repeat 3 times (3 blocks)
 - each block:
  - show the 10 templates, 2s each, back-to-back
